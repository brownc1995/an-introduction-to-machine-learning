# an-introduction-to-machine-learning
This project contains a [paper](an_introduction_to_machine_learning.pdf) I have written that 
highlights the main areas, algorithms and techniques in machine learning and 
deep learning. The writing of this paper was aided greatly by Dr Andrew Ng's 
courses on [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
and [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?).

You should feel free to download and distribute the notes 
if you desire.
